# saas-landing-page

Implement a modern, professional landing page for a SaaS business with the following sections:

- Hero section with a headline, subheadline, and call-to-action button
- Features section highlighting 3-4 key benefits 
- Pricing section with 3 tiers - Basic, Pro, Enterprise. Include key features for each.
- Final CTA section encouraging visitors to get started

Use a clean, modern design with a blue and white color scheme. Include relevant stock imagery.

The company name is not known, so use "Acme" as a placeholder. Also use placeholder text for the features and pricing tiers.
